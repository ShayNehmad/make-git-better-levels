Take a look at the `should_rename_this.py` script. It's finished, but the name isn't very clear about what the script does. The script was given a better name in another **branch** (vicomtesses-apery-vanillin). 

Merge the changes from that branch, ending up with: 
- The new code from the reappraise-veratroyl-garfishes branch
- The new name from the vicomtesses-apery-vanillin branch
