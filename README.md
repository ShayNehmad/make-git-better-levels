Take a look at the runme.py script. It's finished, but the name "runme.py" isn't very clear about what the script does. The script was given a better name in another **branch** (). 

Merge the changes from that branch, ending up with: 
- The new code from the reappraise-veratroyl-garfishes branch
- The new name from the vicomtesses-apery-vanillin branch
