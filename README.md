To pass this stage you'll need a file with the correct password. This work has ALREADY been pushed to a different fork of this repository, which you'll find at 

gamemaster@localhost:~/forked-ctf-repo

You'll have to merge changes from the same branch on the remote.

Note: no need to edit files in this stage, only git commands will suffice.
